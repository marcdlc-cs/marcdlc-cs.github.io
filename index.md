# Hey, I'm <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcdlc/" target="_blank">Marc De La Cruz</a>ðŸ‘‹
You found my Cybersecurity portfolio! Here, I'll document all my adventures in the world of Cybersecurity. You'll find a list of projects that showcases the knowledge I've acquired and the nifty skills I've picked up along the way. Over time, older projects will be replaced by more advanced ones, making it a constantly evolving platform recording my growth and advancement as I level-up my skills and abilities.

Each project is grouped into categories that roughly cover the vast domains of Cybersecurity. They all follow a structured format: the skills I demonstrate, the project scenario, goals and objectives, and the results I achieved. These projects come from a variety of sources, most of which are from certificate programs I've already completed or am currently in such as Coursera's <a href="https://www.credly.com/badges/2dd1e480-11bc-4096-ad6f-8760fb1b0fb4/public_url" target="_blank">Google Cybersecurity Program</a> and Correlation One's <a href="https://www.correlation-one.com/cybersecurity" target="_blank">Cybersecurity For All</a> training program.
